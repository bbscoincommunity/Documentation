# XMR-Stak

XMR-Stak has many internal commands that may be used when launching it. You may see those commands by typing `./xmr-stak --help` , and it will display all available commands to the screen.

Out of these commands, the basic ones we recommend are --noCPU, --noAMD, and --noNVIDIA.

The --noCPU tells xmr-stak to not use the CPU cores, as --noAMD tells it to not load AMD GPUs/drivers, and you probably guessed it, as --noNVIDIA tells it to not load NVIDIA GPUs/drivers for its mining.
